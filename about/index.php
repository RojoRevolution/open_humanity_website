                During times like these, it is important for us to remember that everyone is going through challenges -
                including the charities and organizations that aim to provide goods and services for those in need. And
                while dropping change in a bucket still helps, Open Humanity has a different approach to this “new
                normal” we as a planet are adjusting to.
                <br><br>
                In the middle of a global crisis that has affected and limited the way we handle most in-person
                interactions and operations, Open Humanity has the right idea: humanitarians and vendors can come
                together through a virtual and contactless marketplace to provide products and goods that allow
                charities and organizations to continue to function and thrive.
                <br><br>
                With Open Humanity, charities and organizations can create wish lists of products needed to fulfill
                their missions. Humanitarians can then purchase these products through Open Humanity and vendors will
                deliver them directly to the charities. It’s a chain of people helping people help people. It is exactly
                what the world needs right now.
                <br><br>
                At Open Humanity, we believe that we can restore faith in humanity by working together to change the
                world, by changing the way the world does charity. It just takes a little understanding and a desire to
                positively impact the lives of others.
                <br><br>
                If you are a charity in need, a vendor interested in teaming up, or simply a humanitarian looking to
                contribute, please join our platform and aid us in the fight to make the world a better, brighter,
                warmer place for us all.
                <br><br>
                Help us open humanity!
                <br><br>
                Spread Hope, Spread Kindness, Spread Love!
